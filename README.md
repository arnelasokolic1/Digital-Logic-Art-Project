# IT 208 Digital Logic Art Project

This project demonstrates how digital logic principles can be creatively applied to create visually engaging designs using LEDs and simple logic gates. I used Logisim, a tool for digital circuit simulation, to combine basic digital elements such as AND and NOT gates to create various designs and animations.

## Overview

In this project, I created six unique designs, each using LEDs arranged on a grid. The designs include:

- Flower
- Mandala
- Heart
- Robot (LEDron)
- "CO 208" Text
- A simple shape

These designs utilize basic logic gates like AND and NOT gates, along with clock signals, to control the lighting patterns. The clock signal plays a crucial role in adding movement to the designs by toggling the LEDs on and off in a rhythmic sequence.

## Project Breakdown

### Flower Design

Two versions of the flower design were created:
1. An alternating LED effect using AND and NOT gates.
2. A version with multiple LEDs lit up at once, controlled by AND gates.

### Mandala Design

A symmetric, circular pattern was created with LEDs. The central circle and branches use AND gates for precise lighting control. The clock signal adds a pulse-like effect to make the LEDs light up in a rhythmic sequence.

### Heart Design

Three versions of the heart design were created:
1. Alternating LEDs using AND and NOT gates based on the clock signal.
2. Simultaneous lighting for the upper and lower parts of the heart using AND gates.
3. A dynamic design with LEDs labeled individually, showing how the clock signal affects the state of each LED.

### Robot LEDron Design

A robot figure was created using LEDs to represent the outline and key features like eyes and a chest panel. The clock signal controls the blinking effect for the robot’s eyes and torso.

### CO 208 Design

This design spells out “CO 208” using LEDs, with the clock signal synchronizing the lighting of each section for a clean and readable display.

### Simple Shape Design

A simple shape was created using LEDs, controlled by a clock signal. The LEDs alternate based on the clock's state, creating a flashing effect. A subcircuit and truth table were used to define the behavior of the LEDs.

## Tools Used

- **Logisim**: A digital circuit simulation tool used to design and simulate the logic circuits.
- **Basic Logic Gates**: AND, NOT gates, and clock signals were primarily used to control the LEDs and create dynamic patterns.
